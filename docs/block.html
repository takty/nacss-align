		<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible
			vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
			domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide
			off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as
			he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little
			too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.</p>
